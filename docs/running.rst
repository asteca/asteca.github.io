Running
=======

To run the code simply position a cluster's photometric data file in the
``input/`` folder, and modify the ``asteca.ini`` file to both
inform the code of the distribution of columns in your photometric file
and to set the values for each function within the code.

Once the file(s) are in place and the ``asteca.ini`` file is correctly
edited, the code can be executed with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    (asteca) $ python asteca.py
